Villagers No 

SHREK They'll shave your liver Squeeze the jelly from your eyes Actually it's quite good on toast 

Villager 1 Back Back beast Back I warn ya Waves the torch at Shrek 

Shrek licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch The men shrink back away from him Shrek terrifies the mob with a frightening roar his spit extinguishing all the remaining torches 

SHREK Whispering This is the part where you run away 

The men drop their torches and pitchforks and flee as fast they can 

SHREK And stay out looks down and picks up a wanted poster Reads Wanted Fairytale creatures He sighs and drops the paper on the ground

THE CAPTAIN Seize him 

Donkey dodges the guards as they try to grab him and runs deeper into the forest 

GUARDS He's getting away Get him This way Turn 

Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs head first into Shrek's backside Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him and glares down at Donkey Donkey looks scared of Shrek for a moment but he quickly hides him after seeing that the guards have caught up to him 

THE CAPTAIN You there Ogre 

SHREK Aye 

THE CAPTAIN By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and...(Shrek slowly approaches the group of guards the guards visibly frightened by him transport you to a designated...resettlement...facility 

SHREK Oh really You and what army Smiles 

The Captain looks behind himself and sees that all the other guards have abandoned him The Captain tucks tail and runs off Shrek shakes his head and starts walking back to his swamp Donkey impressed by Shrek follows him
