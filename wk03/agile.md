## Lab03 - Exercise - Agile (Core)

This exercise will be started in the Week 3 tutorial.

### Group Activity

Your tutor will break you up into groups, with people who you are not in the same project team as you. You will have around 10 minutes to share:

* When you are running standups and whether they are synchronous or asynchronous
* How often you meet, how you meet, and what the goals/outcomes of any meetings so far have been
* Have they or will you try pair programming
* Any challenges you've faced already after being in a group

After that time, share thoughts among the class.

### Individual Activity

Inside `agile.md`, make notes on how the other teams in your class are operating - how is it different/similar to your team? What do you think of how they function? Is there anything that they are doing that you want to try?
