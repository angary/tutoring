# Tutorial 07

## A. Requirements

1. As a class, discuss this question:

>  What are attributes of good requirements?

2. In project groups, how could we clean this up into well described requirements?

> How could we clean this up into well described requirements? "I want a burger with lots of pickles and mayo but I need to make sure that the mayo doesn't make the burger bun really wet. Oh, and it needs to be warm, like, made less than 5 minutes ago warm but not so hot that I burn myself. I'm also not a big fan of plastic containers so if it could be in a paper bag that would be good. Actually, make that a brown paper bag, I like the colour of that"

Think about converting the above paragraph into a list of requirements in the following contexts:
* From the Maccas customer to the staff taking the order
* From the staff taking the order to the kitchen

## B. Elicitation

**This exercise links to [Lab07 - Requirements](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1531/redirect/?path=COMP1531/22T1/students/_/lab07_requirements)**.

Complete Part 1 of the lab exercise in pairs, with someone **not** in your project group.

## C. User Stories

As a class, discuss:
* What is your target audience / persona for this application? Use this as your type of user.
* What is a User Story? How are they structured?
* What is an Acceptance Criteria? What are the two ways we can write them?

Start work on Part 2 of the lab exercise. You can continue working in your pairs.

## D. Use Cases

As a class, pick a 'flow' of interaction and between the system and user and write a simple Use Case for this flow together.

Then, in your pairs pick a **different** flow and write a Use Case, starting work on Part 3 of the lab exercise.

## E. Pythonic

Modify [fettucine.py](fettucine.py) to improve it in terms of its adherence to pythonic principles.

## F. Design Principles

A simple piece of code [box.py](box.py) that generates an ASCII box has been provided. What are possible code smells with this code? How would you refactor it to be more consistent with basic software engineering design principles?
