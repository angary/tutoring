## Miscellaneous

### WSL

I would highly recommend all students on Windows to install and use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (feel free to ask me / course forums / CSESoc Discord how to set this up).
This will allow you have a unix like environment within your operating system which is nice because

- it simulates the environment of CSE machines
- a lot of tooling / libraries may only be available for unix systems

and overall, it'll reduce the number of annoying dev related issues you may run into.

### Setup FAQ

**What text editor are you using?**

- I use Visual Studio Code ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) with a theme and the [VIM extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)

**How do you get those colours / autocomplete / git details etc in your terminal?**

- My shell (program that the terminal runs) is ZSH and I use plugins such as
  - git
  - zsh-autosuggestions
  - zsh-syntax-highlighting
  - exa (for coloured `ls` and file icons)
